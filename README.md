# SpyNet PyTorch 🏊🏼‍♀️🏃🏼‍♀️

Modern implementation of SpyNet in PyTorch, along some useful utilities
such as optical flow transformations.

## What SpyNet does?

As stated in the paper's abstract:

> We learn to compute optical flow by combining a classical spatial-pyramid formulation with deep learning. This estimates large motions in a coarse-to-fine approach by warping one image of a pair at each pyramid level by the current flow estimate and computing an update to the flow.

This model is 96% smaller the the FlowNet in terms of parameters.

## Inference 

```python
import spynet
import torchvision.transfroms as T
from PIL import Image

tfms = T.Compose([
    T.ToTensor(),
    T.Normalize(mean=[.485, .406, .456], 
                std= [.229, .225, .224])
])

model = spynet.SpyNet.from_pretrained('sentinel')
model.eval()

frame1 = tfms(Image.open('..')).unsqueeze(0)
frame2 = tfms(Image.open('..')).unsqueeze(0)

flow = model((frame1, frame2))[0]
flow = spynet.flow.flow_to_image(flow)
Image.fromarray(flow).show()
```

## Finetuning the model

To finetune the default `sentinel` pretrained model run:

```bash
$ python -m spynet.train \
    --root data/ \
    --checkpoint-dir models/finetuned-sentinel \
    --finetune-name sentinel \
    --batch-size 32 \
    --epochs 10
```

Then to load the finetuned model do:

```python
import spynet

model = spynet.SpyNet.from_pretrained('models/finetuned-sentinel/final.pt')
model.eval()
```
